# Scheduling System
This Scheduling system is a full stack web application that allows salon receptionist to schedule appointments for multiple Stylists. Customers can leave reviews of the services they received on the company's website as well. Along with the scheduling, the Admin (typically the manager/salon owner) can see an employee stats page which tracks and calculates their stylists' overall rating based on reviews left by customers ranging from 1 to 5 stars. The stats page uses D3 to display the highest rated employees on a graph. In addition, there is an employee time-card system where stylists can clock in and out for their shifts (in the instance that the salon does an hourly wage). The time-card system keeps track of total employee hours and displays each employee's total hours on the stats page for the Admin to see.
